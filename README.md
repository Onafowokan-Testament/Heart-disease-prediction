# Heart Disease Prediction with FastAPI and Machine Learning ‚ù§Ô∏è

Welcome to the **Heart Disease Prediction** project! This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. The model is integrated into a FastAPI web application, allowing users to input their data and receive predictions in real-time. The project uses **scikit-learn** for machine learning and **FastAPI** for building the web interface.

## Features

- **Real-Time Prediction**: Users can input their health data and receive instant predictions.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses a Logistic Regression model trained on heart disease data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes scaling and encoding of categorical variables.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with FastAPI and Jinja2 templates for a seamless user experience.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Users input their health data (e.g., age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) via a web form.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The input data is scaled and encoded to match the format used during model training.
3. **Prediction**: The preprocessed data is passed to the machine learning model, which predicts the likelihood of heart disease.
4. **Result Display**: The prediction result is displayed to the user on the web interface.
